A simple TCP server/client pair.

The application protocol is a simple format: For each file uploaded, the client first sends four
(big-endian) bytes indicating the number of lines as an unsigned binary number.

The client then sends each of the lines, terminated only by '\\n' (an ASCII LF byte).

The server responds with 'A' when it accepts the file.

Then the client can send the next file.


Introduction: (Describe the lab in your own words)
This program allows us to send and receive messages over the network using TCP.
We receive the messages off the network, send a response to the sender to confirm the
message arrived at it's destination, and then write that message to a file.


Summary: (Summarize your experience with the lab, what you learned, what you liked, what you disliked,
and any suggestions you have for improvement)
Our experience with Lab 4 was pretty good.  We found that the hardest part was getting an
original understanding of how TCP sending and receiving works, but after that things went
pretty smoothly.  This lab was more difficult than all of the previous labs because of this
original hoop of understanding what the TCP code setup looks like.
